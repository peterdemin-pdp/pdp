title: Layoff Statistics by Demographics
---

Just as the impact of layoffs can vary by region, they can also vary based on demographics. For instance, our research shows that:

- **61% of adults between 18-34 have layoff anxiety.**
  Young adults are far more likely to have layoff anxiety, with the majority experiencing it. On the other hand, 41% of adults 35 or older have layoff anxiety. Which, while being a smaller percentage, is still a large portion of the population.

- **51% of employees between 18-34 feel unprepared for a layoff.**
  That’s just above the overall average of 47%, and far above the 30% of those over 55 who feel unprepared for a layoff. Once again the youngest workers find themselves most affected by layoffs.

- **Men are 25% more likely to be laid off than women.**
  Overall, 45% of men report that they’ve been laid off compared to only 36% of women. Further, 12% of men have been laid off three or more times, compared to 4% of women.

- **Only 36% of those with a college degree have been laid off.**
  A higher education level leads to a lower likelihood of being laid off. For example, 52% of those with some college have been laid off, and 53% of those with only a High School degree have been laid off.
